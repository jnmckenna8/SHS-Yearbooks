I\u2019m really shocked to find myself actually here to talk about my problems. If anyone had \u000d\u000atold me fifteen years ago that I\u2019d be standing in a Psychiatrist\u2019s office asking for advice. I\u2019d have told them they were \u000d\u000a. . . uh, well, you know what I mean.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cMost people find it helpful to bring everything out in the open. Why don\u2019t you lie down over there and try to \u000d\u000aremember how this all began.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t really know where to start, but it seems to me that my confusion began during my second year of high \u000d\u000aschool.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cWhy do you think that it might have begun at that particular time?\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cThat was the year that I had to take over the duties of the sophomore class when I was elected president. I\u2019m not \u000d\u000areally sure why 1 was chosen; maybe 1 was the only one who didn\u2019t know how difficult the job was going to be.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cTo begin with, the whole class came to school confused by the double session schedule. Our class didn\u2019t even \u000d\u000astart until after lunch and we didn\u2019t get out until dark. It was such a rat race trying to get to class on time. Lockers \u000d\u000athat wouldn\u2019t open and little freshmen in the way, brought many students to the office for an admittance slip. It was \u000d\u000avery hard to get the class all together for a meeting because of bus schedules that couldn\u2019t be altered.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cWe also sold buttons to raise money for the Sophomore Ball. It may sound simple, but to try to find out what \u000d\u000astudents had buttons to sell and who had money to turn in, was quite a problem in itself. To this day, I still have \u000d\u000anightmares about those buttons. I still buy shirts with zippers.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cThen it was time for the Sophomore Ball. I had quite a bit of help from interested students as well as Butch \u000d\u000aEmerson, our vice president; Darlene Denton, secretary; and Kevin Collette, treasurer. But still there were problems and worries \u2014 would it be a success? Would the group get there on time? Did we have enough policemen? Did \u000d\u000awe notify a janitor? And many more problems that made me wonder if I was doing a good job or not.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cWhen the Winter Carnival came, the class was quite encouraged because we won the prize for the best snow \u000d\u000asculpture. But it was only a short success; we were disappointed that it melted away two days later, after all our hard \u000d\u000awork.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cWe didn\u2019t start off very well in our junior year, for Miss Dunlap, our co-advisor, left us to become Mrs. Pashler. \u000d\u000aWe were thankful that Mr. Moynihan had been with us since our freshman year, but we needed someone else to \u000d\u000ahelp out. Mrs. Brennan came to our rescue to complete our Irish advisor team.\u201d\u000d\u000a82","\u201cYet our troubles came fast and they became bigger. First, it was the Junior Candy Sale. You wouldn\u2019t believe the \u000d\u000aconfusion. Just try to get 344 juniors to sell 1200 boxes of candy and that\u2019s chaos! Most of them sold their boxes of \u000d\u000acandy and all on one night which added to the confusion.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cTell me, Mr. Coons, didn\u2019t you have any assistance with these projects?\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cOh, yes, our class officers helped a lot and we also had two co-chairmen: Mary Polichnowski and Maryann Veno. \u000d\u000aAfter two weeks, we had sold every box, quite an accomplishment! The team selling the most boxes were Debbie Fox, \u000d\u000aDave Lemay, Cindy Pelley, Steve Harrington, Jeff Figgins, and Kevin Hussey, who all divided the prize, fifty dollars.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cWell, Mr. Coons, it sounds as if your problems were beginning to increase as the years rolled by. Tell me more: I\u2019m \u000d\u000avery interested.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cWe started planning for the Junior Prom just before Christmas vacation by choosing our co-chairmen and a coordinating committee. In February deadline problems arose . . . ordering decorations to highlight the theme \u201cPieces \u000d\u000aof April,\u201d hiring the Ace Tones, and it seemed like 1,000 other things. When the actual decorating began, so did my \u000d\u000aulcers. I can still hear cries o f . . . \u201cOh, no! They sent the wrong background paper! We don't have enough flowers for \u000d\u000athe arch! Where\u2019s Steve? We ran out of paint again! Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. Brennan . . . anyone!! We\u2019ve got only three \u000d\u000ahours left! Who\u2019s going to take our coats?\u201d . . . Finally, at one o\u2019clock Friday morning. May 18th, the gym was transformed, and our fears had been groundless. Our class had one of the most beautiful proms in Spaulding\u2019s history, led \u000d\u000aby Prom Queen Darlene Denton and King John McKenna.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cWell, Mr. Coons, it seems as if your problems were just about over.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cOh, no! Our senior year seemed to contain a crisis a day. My major problem was communications \u2014 being entirely \u000d\u000acut off from important announcements until the day after. The Executive Board finally had to resort to attending all \u000d\u000athe social and sports functions to get a consensus vote on graduation activities; even then, we had to catch our many \u000d\u000astar senior athletes on the run during intermission. However, we did make it through the trip, banquet, reception, and \u000d\u000agraduation, itself.\u201d\u000d\u000aAnything else you want to talk about. Doc?\u201d\u000d\u000aYes, you didn\u2019t mention your Freshman year. Any anxieties then?\u201d\u000d\u000aJust the same as any freshman; we all worried about getting through the Freshman-Senior Reception without antagonizing the \u201cmighty seniors\u201d or spitting out the strained baby food. Kevin Collette, president, led us through the last \u000d\u000a\u201cnormal\u201d school session we experienced before graduation. Our freshman life was carefree compared to what we later \u000d\u000afaced. Well, Doc, what do you think? Can I be helped?\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cWell. Mr. Coons, I would prescribe a class reunion where you can reminisce with old friends. That\u2019s the best therapy I know.\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cGee. thanks. Doc. I really appreciate you listening. I think I\u2019ll call up Darlene, Jennifer, and Dick to see if we can \u000d\u000aarrange one.
